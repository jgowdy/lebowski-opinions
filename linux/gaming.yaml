  Gaming and real-time optimized kernel with minimum latency configuration.

  Optimized for:
  - Competitive gaming (minimum input lag)
  - Game streaming
  - VR applications
  - Real-time audio production

  Uses 1000Hz timer, full preemption, and other low-latency optimizations.

modifications:
  kernel_config:
    # Maximum timer frequency
    CONFIG_HZ_1000: "y"
    CONFIG_HZ: "1000"

    # Full preemption (consider PREEMPT_RT for even lower latency)
    CONFIG_PREEMPT: "y"
    CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT: "y"

    # Reduce scheduling latency
    CONFIG_SCHED_AUTOGROUP: "n"

    # High-res timers
    CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS: "y"

    # Tickless
    CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL: "y"

    # CPU frequency scaling for performance
    # (Note: Users may want to set governor to 'performance')

performance_notes: |
  For best gaming performance, also set CPU governor to 'performance':

  echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

  Expected improvements:
  - Lower frame time variance
  - Reduced input lag (5-10ms improvement)
  - Smoother frame pacing
  - Better 1% and 0.1% lows in benchmarks
